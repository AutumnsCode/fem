## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

This project was harder as I thought. The mobile went quite easy, however, I struggled a lot with the layout, when it came to the larger size. First, I used background-image, but switch to picture element after a suggestion from a discord user. However, then I faced issue with the image as it didn't size the full length of the article. The solution was to use a object-fit in it. 

### Continued development

Since I struggle with layout, I will continue workin on it.


### Useful resources

- [Fedmentor](https://fedmentor.dev/) - This helped me figure out the picture element and with the font-size.
